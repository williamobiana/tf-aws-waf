## Documentation
We use a library called `terraform-docs` for automatically generating documentation for the variables, outputs, resources, and sub-modules defined within a Terraform module.   
The output from `terraform-docs` is wrapped between `HEADER.md` and `FOOTER.md` files which include custom module documentation and usage guidelines.

To ensure our documentation remains up-to-date, it is important that each time changes are made to a module the docs are updated by cd'ing into the module directory and running the following command:  

`terraform-docs --config docs/terraform-docs.yml markdown --escape=false . > README.md`
